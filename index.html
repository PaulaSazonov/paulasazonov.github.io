            <h1>Hello,
                <br> I'm Paula.</h1>
            <p>I'm an aspiring software developer, who is passionate about professional development and reaching my full potential.</p>

        <h1>My story</h1>
        <p>I have a Master's degree in English Philology from Helsinki University, but found myself wanting to change lanes
            into a career in IT. I'm an ambitious and hardworking spirit who's never afraid of a little challenge, so I applied
            in an intensive learning program in programming. After multiple years of academia, I found the idea of hands-on
            learning welcome, and was convinced that the only way to learn to code, is to code. The spring of 2018 was an
            immersive experience into the world of software development, and resulted in core understanding and an eagerness
            for life-long learning! </p>
        <p>The accelerated learning program was focused around Java, but covered a number of other areas as well. I learned
            server-side programming, database handling, front end development, agile product development, UX-design and cloud-computing.
            I was also active in making use of Helsinki University's massive open online courses on CS, and after the program
            took the open online course "Elements of AI" by Reaktor and Helsinki University. I am passionate about learning.
            My plan is to continue perfecting my coding skills and hope the future holds an opportunity to be able to some
            day call myself a full stack web developer.</p>

                <p>"Leluhaku" was a single-page web application for searching toys and comparing prices. This was a group project
                    by three people, executed in an eight-day sprint. The project was part of an accelerated learning program,
                    I was responsible for the front end development and user interface design using React.js. Before this
                    project we had three days of teaching on React and one week where we covered HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
                    It was very much a "learn as you do"-project, and I learned a lot. We had many plans for future development,
                    but were also content with what we could accomplish in such a short sprint.</p>

                This was an application using real time train traffic information from Finnish Transportation Agency's open data service Digitraffic.
                The application provides a text-based user interface for searching train information. You can search information
                by train number or by station (all departing trains from a specific station, or all trains running between
                two stations). You can also search a specific train's geographical location by coordinates or location by
                which stations it has passed if it's currently running. The application covers both long-distance trains
                and commuter trains. This was a group project for an accelerated learning program in Java, accomplished by
                a group of four people in three days, with three weeks of teaching behind us.</p>
